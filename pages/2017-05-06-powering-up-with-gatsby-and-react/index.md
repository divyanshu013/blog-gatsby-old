I'm really in ❤️ with how the JavaScript community is progressing. The entire ecosystem
around the current state of JavaScript is mindblowing. I tried hacking on to [GatsbyJs](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and
[ReactJs](https://facebook.github.io/react/) on this blog and the results were just amazing. I'll try to summarize the
findings in this post.

### ✔️ Built on modern web technologies

**Gatsby** makes use of a modern stack encompassing **React**, **Webpack**, **hot module replacement**
and many other juicy features which makes the blogging experience painless.

I've found it to be much better than **Jekyll** or **Hexo** since adding features to your blog
is as simple as adding a react component.

### ✔️ Extensible

Gatsby is quite simple to understand and add more to once you get a hang of the
project structure. You can even create your own blog using some other blog as a starter
template like:

```bash
gatsby new blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

You can write posts in simple markdown or even in JavaScript (Thank you JSX!).
A benefit of this is adding your own JavaScript components in your posts, good luck
trying that on Jekyll 😛

### ✔️ Fast deployment and hot reload

Deployments on Gatsby are quite fast and the development experience is even more
awesome with hot reloading and Webpack. No more refresh to see changes!

### ✔️ Great SEO

I need to experiment more on this, however I've read pretty good things about this.
